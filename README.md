# minimal-blog

A minimal blog project containing CRUDs for `Categories` and `Posts`.

The purpose of the project was to test architectural app structuring and testing.

It covers both `Integration` and `Unit` testing.

### Note:
The behavior of middlewares was covered in test cases during `Integration` testing.
That is why it was purposefully left out of `Unit` testing.
`Unit` tests only cover `Repositories` and `Services`.
